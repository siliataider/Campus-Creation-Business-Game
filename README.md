# Campus Cr√©ation

This is the code we used for the product that our business game project featured
It's a product designed to help people with disabilities, as by clicking on some very well though/ accessible bottons, shortcuts are made.
Instead of clicking on the desktop item, look for the gmail app, search for their son's email address, and write the mail, all they have to do is click on a button!
